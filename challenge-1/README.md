# Algorand Fix The Bug Challenge #1

> Ensure you review the README for comprehensive instructions on how to participate in this challenge.

## Description

Inside of `index.ts` file, there is a script that sends a payment transaction that sends 1,000,000 microAlgos (1 ALGO) to the receiver's wallet. However if you try running the `index.ts` file after opening Docker Desktop and then running:
```bash
algokit bootstrap all
algokit localnet start
npm start
```
it will fail and show this error: `TypeError: Argument must be byte array`

**Find out what is wrong and fix the bug.**
