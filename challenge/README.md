> Ensure you review the README for comprehensive instructions on how to participate in this challenge.

## Description

Inside of `index.ts` file, there is a script that sends a payment transaction that sends 1,000,000 microAlgos (1 ALGO) to the receiver's wallet. However if you try running the `index.ts` file after opening Docker Desktop and then running:
```bash
algokit bootstrap all
algokit localnet start
npm run start
```
it will fail and show this error: `TypeError: Argument must be byte array`

**Find out what is wrong and fix the bug.**

## Instructions

### 1. Set up your development environment

Install dependencies and autogenerate the `.env` file using AlgoKit. Run the below command inside of the `challenge` folder.
```bash
algokit bootstrap all
```

Now you are ready to fix the bug!

### 2. Steps to fix the bug

1. Open Docker Desktop and launch Algorand localnet with `algokit localnet start`. 
2. Run `npm run start` in the `challenge` directory to run the `index.ts` file and see the error message.
3. Go to `index.ts` file and fix the code to make it work. 
4. Run `npm run start` in `challenge` directory to run the `index.ts` file.
